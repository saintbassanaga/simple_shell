# simple_shell
A simple UNIX command interpreter making as a final project of the low-level programming and algorithm quarter at ALX school of software engineering

# Overview
```CoolSH``` is a sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

# Invocation
Usage: ```CoolSH``` is started with the standard input connected to the terminal. To start, compile all .c located in this repository by using this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o coolsh ./coolsh is allowed to be invoked interactively and non-interactively. If ```CoolSH``` is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.
